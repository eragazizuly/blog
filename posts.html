                    <p><strong>Life can get complicated really quickly</strong>, but it doesn't have to be! There are
                        many
                        ways
                        to simplify your
                        life, <a href="">a few of which we've explored in the past</a>. This week we're taking a bit of
                        a
                        approach though, in

                    <h2>Keeping cooking simple</h2>
                    <p>Food is a very important part of everyone's life. If you want to be healthy, you have to eat
                        healthy.
                        One
                        of the easiest ways to do that is to keep your cooking nice and simple.</p>

                    <h2>Simplicity and work </h2>
                    <p>Work is often a major source of stress. People get frustrated, it ruins their
                        relationship with others and it leads to burnout. By keeping your work life as simple as
                        possible,
                        it
                        will help balance everything out.</p>

                    <h2>Simple decorations</h2>
                    <p>A home isn't a home until you've decorated a little. People either don't decorate, or
                        they go overboard and it doesn't have the impact they were hoping for. Staying simple will help
                        draw
                        the
                        eye where you want it to and make things pop like never before. </p>

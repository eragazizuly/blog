            <h2>My name is Yerassyl and living simple life saved my life</h2>
            <p><strong>I used to be a pack rat</strong>. I had so many things that I thought that I loved, but the truth
                was I couldn't
                even appreciate any of it because there was too much. </p>
            <p>Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live in, and I couldn't hold
                a relationship.</p>
            <h2 class="blue-header">How I turned things around</h2>
            <p><strong>I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything.</strong> I literally put 90% of
                my possessions in
                the garbage, sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job.</p>
            <p>It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I didn't know what else to do.
                And it worked. </p>
            <h2 class="blue-header">Now I live the simple life</h2>
            <p>Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work
                more, and I have more free time to enjoy.</p>
            <p>With how much it turned my life around, <strong>I felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I
                    did it</strong>,
                and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I started this site!</p>
